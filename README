Congratulations on selecting the second generation of 
Galactic Bloodshed clients.

A couple of quick notes.

1) This client shall be constantly changing for better or for worse.
So check the ftp site for upgrades constantly.

2) I try to make this client compile on as many systems as possible.
If for some reason it does not, please let me know. And also if you make
any changes to get it to compile, please tell me of the changes and I will
incorporate them as compile time options.

3) How to compile the client. Run the setup script. Just type 'setup'
or './setup' for those who are wary and don't have . in their $PATH.
Answer the questions as best as you can. If you are unsure of how
to answer the question, then just choose the default (hit return).
After answering the questions, pray and hope the client compiles
nicely. If not, please be descriptive about the problem and if
possible, include the make output.

4) Also, you may preset certain commands in a .gbrc found
in your $HOME directory. This file is generated by using the
savef command while running the client. Any changes to the
default settings of the client will be save for future loading.
Things like set options, crypts, binds, defs, and others.
Read the help file for a more complete description.

You can predefine the location of the .gbrc file through the
environmental variable GBRC. If it is defined, the client will try
to open and load this file instead of the $HOME/.gbrc.

5) If you are going to use it on a X environment, you may want to
make the client with the XMAP option defined. This is _UNSUPPORTED_
by me, it is supported by sander@engin.umich.edu. I have NOTHING to do with
it what so ever. I don't know X and I do NOT have access to a X machine.

6) Just type 'setup'. Follow the directions and you should get gbII.

How to use gbII you ask?

Simple. Just type 'gbII'.

The full syntax for gbII is:

gbII [-adehlrsvE?] [-e<filename>] [-i<filename>]
     [-V<server_version#>] [host | nick] [port]
	
	-a              toggles autologin
	-f		fast startup. do not read GBRC(~/.gbrc by default)
	-d              toggles display_from_top 
	-h              this help screen
	-l              does a listgame command and exits
	-r              toggles repeat_connect
	-s              toggle login_suppress
	-?              this help screen
	-v              prints out client version and exits.
	-E              edit mode. Enters gbII, without connecting to a game.
	-R				toggles raw mode
	-e<filename>    will use <filename> as a script file for reading input.
	-i<filename>    will start gbII with filename as an init file.
	-V<version#>    for backwards compatibility (currently not used)
	host            host site to connect to.     
	nick            use this game entry to find for connection
	port            port to connect on.
	
	
	Any of these command line arguments are optional.

	You may define the environment variables GBHOST and GBPORT.
	(for some UNIX that is setenv GBHOST 'name')

7) There is on-line help for the client. type 'helpc'
(help is reserved by the server)

8) If you have a problem in compiling or a problem with the client
then please fill out the file BUGREPORT and mail this to my email
address listed in the file.
