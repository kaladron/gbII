Things to do to xmap as of 2/9/93:

Improve scope identification for xorbit.

Ping sectors and planet stats periodically so map doesn't get too out of date.

Add point and click info to xorbit - e.g. click on planet cs's there & maps;
click on ship gives report/order/fuel/ship.

Add complex move/deploy at planet level. Though could always just be typed
using input panel.

Improve input window editing. (started 12/92)
