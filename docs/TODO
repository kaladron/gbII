def x survey ; who
/x >! test.log doesn't work.

fix up slash_commands to work better. internal  generated commands
muck this up.

fix up client_command and way output is handled.
any commands which have an obvious start/end should be 'hidden' 
to reduce screen clutter.

add something to display the end_prompt if it is the only response
from the server. altho broadcast/ann/th will muss this up.

make an array of server commands seperate from client commands

add a at time feature.

fix up the if() stuff to work complexly.
expression /*-+% && ||

add the ability of assign to handle math.
assign x = x + 1
/*+-% and () should do it.
